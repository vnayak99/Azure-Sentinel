# Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management Sentinel Data Connector
Author: Alex Anders

This custom data connector uses a Function App to pull Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management (MDVM) data from the M365 Defender API and ingests into the selected Log Analytics workspace via the Azure Monitor DCR API. Public NIST CVE information is also ingested to enrich the MDVM data. A custom workbook is also included to visualize the data. Six custom tables are created in the workspace:
- *MDVMCVEKB_CL* - MDVM CVE knowledge base.
- *MDVMNISTCVEKB_CL* - NIST CVE knowledge base
- *MDVMNISTConfigurations_CL* - NIST CVE knowledge base: known vulnerable software configurations.
- *MDVMRecommendations_CL* - MDVM recommendations.
- *MDVMSecureConfigurationsByDevice_CL* - Secure configuration assessment details for each device.
- *MDVMVulnerabilitiesByDevice_CL* - Vulnerability assessment details for each device.

## **Pre-requisites**
1. An Azure Subscription
2. An Azure Sentinel/Log Analytics workspace
3. Permissions required to deploy resources:
    - Owner permissions on the target resource group.
    - Log Analytics Contributor or higher permissions on the destination Log Analytics workspace.
4. Permissions required for assigning the needed permissions post deployment:
    - Global Admin or Application Administrator privileges on Defender Azure AD tenant. This is to give the solution access to the Defender API.
    - Owner or User Access Administrator access to subscriptions containing Virtual Machines or Arc Server resources. This is to provide the solution reader access.

## **Deployment Process**
## 1. Deploy Azure Resources
1. Click the **Deploy to Azure** button above.
2. Once in the Azure Portal, select the **Subscription** and **Resource Group** to deploy the resources into.
3. Populate the required **Log Analytics Workspace ID** and **Location** parameters. Modify the default parameters as needed but most users can leave these alone.
4. Click **Review and Create**.
5. Click **Create**.
6. When the deployment has completed, grab the UserAssignedManagedIdentityPrincipalId and UserAssignedManagedIdentityPrincipalName values from the deployment Outputs section. These will be used in the next step.

## 2. Assign Needed Permissions
After the resources have been deployed, we need to assign the appropriate M365 Defender API and Azure permissions to the newly created User Assigned Managed Identity by doing the following:
1. From a PowerShell prompt, connect to Azure via [Connect-AzAccount -TenantId [The Tenant ID your Defender instance resides in.]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/az.accounts/connect-azaccount?view=azps-9.2.0) with an account that has the Global Admin or Application Administrator role assigned. Then, run the following PowerShell commands:
```PowerShell
#UserAssignedManagedIdentityPrincipalId value Copied from step 1.6 above. INSERT THE VALUE BETWEEN THE SINGLE QUOTES BELOW.
$managedIdentityPrincipalId = '' 
$permissions = "SecurityRecommendation.Read.All", "Vulnerability.Read.All"

#Lookup Resource and App Roles (permissions).
$resource =  Get-AzADServicePrincipal -Filter "DisplayName eq 'WindowsDefenderATP'"
$appRoles = $resource.AppRole | Where-Object Value -in $permissions

#Assign App Roles to Managed Identity.
foreach ($appRole in $appRoles) {
    $body = @{
        principalId = $ManagedIdentityPrincipalId
        resourceId = $resource.Id
        appRoleId = $appRole.id
    }
    (Invoke-AzRestMethod -Method POST -Uri ("https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/servicePrincipals/" + $resource.Id + "/appRoleAssignedTo") -Payload (ConvertTo-Json $body)).Content | ConvertFrom-Json
}
```
2. Create a custom role to limit the level of access to only read VM's and Arc Servers. Do this by: 
    1. Navigate to the appropriate management group/subscription in the Azure portal.
    2. Select the **Access Control (IAM)** menu.
    3. Select **Add** => **Custom role**
    4. Give the custom role a unique name within the tenant.
    5. Select the **JSON** tab, and replace the **Actions** section with the below:
         ```
         "actions": [
                    "Microsoft.Compute/*/read",
                    "Microsoft.HybridCompute/*/read"
                ],
        ```
    6. Complete the custom role creation by selecting the **Review + Create** tab, and then clicking **Create**.

3. Assign the User Assigned Managed Identity access to all management groups/subscriptions that contain Virtual Machine or Arc Server resources. Do this by: 
    1. Navigate to the appropriate management group/subscription in the Azure portal.
    2. Select **Add** => **Add Role Assignment**.
    3. Select the **Custom Role** that was created in the previous step and click Next.
    4. Select **Managed Identity**, Select **Members**, and search for the **User Assigned Managed Identity** created during the deployment. The name was capture in step 6 above.
    5. Click Next, then Review and Assign.
