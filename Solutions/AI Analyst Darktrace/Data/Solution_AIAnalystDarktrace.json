	"Description": "The [AI Analyst Darktrace](https://www.darktrace.com/en/cyber-ai-analyst/) Solution for Microsoft Sentinel lets users connect Darktrace Model Breaches in real-time with Microsoft Sentinel, allowing creation of custom Dashboards, Workbooks, Notebooks and Custom Alerts to improve investigation. Microsoft Sentinel's enhanced visibility into Darktrace logs enables monitoring and mitigation of security threats.\n\r\n1. **AI Analyst Darktrace via AMA** - This data connector helps in ingesting AI Analyst Darktrace logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the new Azure Monitor Agent. Learn more about ingesting using the new Azure Monitor Agent [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-cef-ama). **Microsoft recommends using this Data Connector**.\n\r\n2. **AI Analyst Darktrace via Legacy Agent** - This data connector helps in ingesting AI Analyst Darktrace logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the legacy Log Analytics agent.\n\n**NOTE:** Microsoft recommends installation of AI Analyst Darktrace via AMA Connector. Legacy connector uses the Log Analytics agent which is about to be deprecated by **Aug 31, 2024,** and thus should only be installed where AMA is not supported. Using MMA and AMA on same machine can cause log duplication and extra ingestion cost [more details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/ama-migrate).",
