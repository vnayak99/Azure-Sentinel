    "Description": "The [Cisco Secure Email Gateway (SEG)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/email-security/index.html) solution provides the capability to ingest [Cisco SEG Consolidated Event Logs](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/esa/esa14-0/user_guide/b_ESA_Admin_Guide_14-0/b_ESA_Admin_Guide_12_1_chapter_0100111.html#con_1061902) into Microsoft Sentinel.\n\r\n1. **CiscoSEG via AMA** - This data connector helps in ingesting CiscoSEG logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the new Azure Monitor Agent. Learn more about ingesting using the new Azure Monitor Agent [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-cef-ama). **Microsoft recommends using this Data Connector**.\n\r\n2. **CiscoSEG via Legacy Agent** - This data connector helps in ingesting CiscoSEG logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the legacy Log Analytics agent.\n\n**NOTE:** Microsoft recommends installation of CiscoSEG via AMA Connector. Legacy connector uses the Log Analytics agent which is about to be deprecated by **Aug 31, 2024,** and thus should only be installed where AMA is not supported. Using MMA and AMA on same machine can cause log duplication and extra ingestion cost [more details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/ama-migrate).",
