    "Description": "The Illusive Platform solution for Microsoft Sentinel enables you to ingest Illusive Platformâ€™s attack surface analysis data and incident logs into Microsoft Sentinel and view this information in dedicated dashboards that offer insight into your organization's attack surface risk (ASM Dashboard) and track unauthorized lateral movement in your organization's network (ADS Dashboard).\n\r\n1. **Illusive Platform via AMA** - This data connector helps in ingesting Illusive Platform logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the new Azure Monitor Agent. Learn more about ingesting using the new Azure Monitor Agent [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-cef-ama). **Microsoft recommends using this Data Connector**.\n\r\n2. **Illusive Platform via Legacy Agent** - This data connector helps in ingesting Illusive Platform logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the legacy Log Analytics agent.\n\n**NOTE:** Microsoft recommends installation of Illusive Platform via AMA Connector. Legacy connector uses the Log Analytics agent which is about to be deprecated by **Aug 31, 2024,** and thus should only be installed where AMA is not supported. Using MMA and AMA on same machine can cause log duplication and extra ingestion cost [more details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/ama-migrate).",
