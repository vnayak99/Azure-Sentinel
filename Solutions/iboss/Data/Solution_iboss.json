  "Description": "The iboss Solution provides means to connect your Threat Console to Microsoft Sentinel and enrich your instance with iboss URL event logs. Our logs are forwarded in Common Event Format (CEF) over Syslog and the configuration required can be completed on the iboss platform without the use of a proxy. Take advantage of our connector to garner critical data points and gain insight into security threats.\n\r\n1. **Iboss via AMA** - This data connector helps in ingesting Iboss logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the new Azure Monitor Agent. Learn more about ingesting using the new Azure Monitor Agent [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-cef-ama). **Microsoft recommends using this Data Connector**.\n\r\n2. **Iboss via Legacy Agent** - This data connector helps in ingesting Iboss logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the legacy Log Analytics agent.\n\n**NOTE:** Microsoft recommends installation of Iboss via AMA Connector. Legacy connector uses the Log Analytics agent which is about to be deprecated by **Aug 31, 2024,** and thus should only be installed where AMA is not supported. Using MMA and AMA on same machine can cause log duplication and extra ingestion cost [more details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/ama-migrate).",
