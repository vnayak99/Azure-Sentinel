  "Description": "The [Cisco Firepower](https://www.cisco.com/site/in/en/products/security/firewalls/index.html) eStreamer Solution for Microsoft Sentinel works with [Cisco Event Streamer](https://github.com/CiscoSecurity/fp-05-microsoft-sentinel-connector) (also known as eStreamer) and allows you to stream System intrusion, discovery and connection data from Firepower Management Center (FMC) or managed device to Sentinel \r\n eStreamer is a Client Server API designed for the Cisco Firepower NGFW Solution. The eStreamer client requests detailed event data on behalf of the SIEM or logging solution in the Common Event Format (CEF).\n\r\n1. **Cisco Firepower EStreamer via AMA** - This data connector helps in ingesting Cisco Firepower EStreamer logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the new Azure Monitor Agent. Learn more about ingesting using the new Azure Monitor Agent [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-cef-ama). **Microsoft recommends using this Data Connector**.\n\r\n2. **Cisco Firepower EStreamer via Legacy Agent** - This data connector helps in ingesting Cisco Firepower EStreamer logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the legacy Log Analytics agent.\n\n**NOTE:** Microsoft recommends installation of Cisco Firepower EStreamer via AMA Connector. Legacy connector uses the Log Analytics agent which is about to be deprecated by **Aug 31, 2024,** and thus should only be installed where AMA is not supported. Using MMA and AMA on same machine can cause log duplication and extra ingestion cost [more details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/ama-migrate).",
