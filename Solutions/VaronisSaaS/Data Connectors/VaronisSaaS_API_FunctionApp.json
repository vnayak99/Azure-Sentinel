Extract archive to your local development computer.\n2. Start VS Code. Choose File in the main menu and select Open Folder.\n3. Select the top-level folder from the extracted files.\n4. Click the Azure icon in the Activity bar, then in the Azure: Functions area, choose the Deploy to function app button. If you aren't already signed in, click the Azure icon in the Activity bar, then in the Azure: Functions area, choose Sign in to Azure. If you're already signed in, go to the next step.\n5. Provide the following information at the prompts:\n\t- Select folder: Choose a folder from your workspace or browse to one that contains your function app.\n\t- Select Subscription: Choose the subscription to use.\n\t- Select Create new Function App in Azure (Don't choose the Advanced option).\n\t- Enter a globally unique name for the function app: Type a name that is valid in a URL path. The name you type is validated to make sure that it's unique in Azure Functions.\n\t- Select a runtime: Choose DOTNET 6.0.\n\t- Select a location for new resources. For better performance and lower costs, choose the same region where Microsoft Sentinel is located.\n\t6. Deployment will begin.
